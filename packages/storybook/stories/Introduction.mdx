## Technology Stack

- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html)

## How It Is Built

Each component is a React forwardRef component that uses the `useComponent` hook to manage the component's state and props. The `useComponent` hook is a custom hook that uses the `useAria` hook from React Aria to manage the component's accessibility and focus management. The `useComponent` hook also uses the `useMotion` hook from Framer Motion to manage the component's animations and transitions.

Each component is built with TypeScript and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. A MotionWindUI plugin is created for TailwindCSS to allow for theming and additional colors / styles.

MotionWindUI also comes with a `extendComponentVaraints` function that allows you to override / add additional Tailwind CSS variants to the components.

MotionWindUI also comes with a set of utility packages and hooks that help with a variety of aspects, such as utility for a component, hooks for managing states and more.
