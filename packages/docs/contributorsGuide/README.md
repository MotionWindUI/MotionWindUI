# Contributor's Guide

This guide is a React application that is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. The goal of the guide is to provide a handy reference for contributors to the project. It includes information on how to add new features, fix bugs, write documentation, set up a development environment, and more.

This guide is a work in progress. It is not published as this does not need to be published on a domain. Instead you can run the guide locally on your machine.

## Installation

To run the guide locally, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

After you have installed Node.js, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
pnpm install
```

## Running the Guide

To run the guide locally, you can use the following command (start at the root of the repository):

```bash
pnpm run docs:dev
```
