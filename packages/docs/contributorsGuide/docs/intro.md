## Introduction

Please note that this guide and documentation are a work in progress and are meant to be used as a reference for contributors.

> **Note:** This is a personal project and is not affiliated with any organization or company. I am a solo developer working on this project in my free time. I am not a professional designer or front-end developer (I am more of an embedded engineer ðŸ˜„). This project is a learning experience for me, focusing on web development and accessibility.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who has interacted with this project. A special thanks to the NextUI project, which has been a significant source of inspiration. You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui). I have learned a lot from their work, and much of the code is based on their smart solutions.

## What is MotionWindUI?

MotionWindUI is a React component library that provides a set of accessible and customizable components for building web applications. It leverages Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion to offer beautiful, accessible, responsive, and customizable components. MotionWindUI is built with TypeScript and is fully typed. To achieve accessibility, MotionWindUI components are built on top of React Aria, a library that provides accessible UI primitives for React.

MotionWindUI is inspired by NextUI, another React component library that offers similar features. Many of the decisions and foundations in this project are based on and inspired by NextUI.
